# Overview
This Jupyter Notebook is designed for processing and analyzing audio datasets. It uses libraries such as librosa, numpy, and matplotlib to perform audio feature extraction, visualization, and other related tasks. The notebook includes steps for downloading data, preparing it for analysis, and executing various audio processing functions.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure the following dependencies are installed in your Python environment:

Python 3.x

Required libraries:
librosa
numpy
matplotlib
h5py
ipywidgets

To install the required libraries, run:

pip install librosa numpy matplotlib h5py ipywidgets

## Data Preparation
### Downloading the Dataset
The notebook automatically downloads two required datasets:

annotations.zip
audio_mono-mic.zip

These datasets are retrieved from Zenodo.
https://zenodo.org/records/3371780

### Unzipping the Files
The notebook includes code to unzip and prepare the downloaded data for analysis.

## Key Features
Audio Visualization: 
- Display waveforms and spectrograms of audio files.
Audio Processing: 
- Feature extraction using librosa (e.g., Mel-frequency spectrograms).
- Interactive widgets to play audio and visualize specific features.
File Management:
- Automated handling of datasets and extraction of contents from zip files.
Interactivity:
- Integration with Jupyter widgets for an enhanced interactive experience.

## How to Use
1. Open the Notebook: Launch the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.

2. Execute the Cells:
- Start by running the setup cells to install dependencies and download the data.
- Proceed to the analysis and visualization sections.

3. Modify Parameters:
- Customize paths, parameters for feature extraction, or visualization settings to suit your requirements.

## Outputs
Visualizations: Waveforms, spectrograms, and other plots are generated inline.
Audio Playback: Interactive playback widgets for audio files.

Additional Notes
Ensure a stable internet connection to download datasets.
GPU acceleration is enabled for compatible environments, such as Google Colab.
